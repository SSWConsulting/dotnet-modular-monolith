## Goal

Sample repo demoing how an e-commerce system can be architected as a modular monolith using ASP.NET Core.

## Modules

### Orders Module

Responsible for Order Management

- Order Creation
- Order Lifecycle Management
- Payment: taking and recording payment
- Shipping: Calculating fee, dispatching, tracking

### Warehouse Module

Responsible for Warehouse and Inventory Management

- Stock Levels - How much do we actually have?
- Inventory Tracking - Where is the item in the warehouse?
- Supplier Chain - Where can I buy the item from?
- Restocking - When do we need to restock?
- Backorders - When do we put items on back order?
- Product Management

## Business Invariants

Warehouse:
- An Aisle cannot have duplicate bays
- A bay cannot have duplicate shelves

Product Catalog:
- A product must have a name
- A product can be given one or more categories
- A product cannot have a negative price
- A product cannot duplicate categories

Customers:

- Must have an address

Cart:

Orders:
- An order must be associated with a customer
- The order total must always be correct
- The order tax must always be correct

- Payment must be completed for the order to be placed (FUTURE: Consider splitting payments to it's own module)
